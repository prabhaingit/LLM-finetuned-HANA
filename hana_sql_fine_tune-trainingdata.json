Each row in this table represents a unique sales document. The VBELN column in this table is a unique identifier for each sales document.2. VBAP (Sales Document: Item Data): This table contains item-level data for each sales document. Each row in this table represents a unique item within a sales document. The VBELN column in this table is used to link each item to a sales document in the VBAK table. The MATNR column in this table is used to link each item to a material in the MARA table.3. MARA (Material Master Data): This table contains master data for each material. Each row in this table represents a unique material. The MATNR column in this table is a unique identifier for each material.The VBAK and VBAP tables are linked through the VBELN column, which represents the sales document number. The VBAP and MARA tables are linked through the MATNR column, which represents the material number.This means that for each sales document in the VBAK table, there can be multiple items in the VBAP table. Each of these items is linked to a material in the MARA table. This allows us to trace each item in a sales document back to its material master data."
